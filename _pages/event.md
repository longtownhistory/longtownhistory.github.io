Jazma contacted Lori, who runs the facebook page, and Ricky after seeing things about the homecoming. We asked permission to do the homecoming, and Brenda Jett was our next contact as the homecoming organizer. She asked permission fromthe pastor of the church, and from there, Jazma and Laurie worked to post event info Longtown/Greenville descendants

Roane provided a tour here (link), and you can also see some of the preservation efforts

This online archive sits at the intersection of several historians' efforts, an ongoing community self-preservation effort that is centuries in the works, and a History-Harvest tradition that supports all of these practices.

As we explored the theory bhind digial public engagement, we began to engage more deeplyw ith the community's need to own and manage their own history and we began to think more fully about how institutional support and partnership in stabilizing the content from the FB page might help support the community need to have an easy-to-use centralized platform that fed a stable archive.


<!-- Labor also matters http://www.neatline.org/credits/ and look at our credits page so that you can see how people contributed and how we acknowledge the iportance of those contributions from a variety of places.-->
