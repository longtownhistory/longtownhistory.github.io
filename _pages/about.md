This online archive sits at the intersection of several historians' efforts, an ongoing community self-preservation effort that is centuries in the works, and a History-Harvest tradition that supports all of these practices.

As we explored the theory bhind digial public engagement, we began to engage more deeplyw ith the community's need to own and manage their own history and we began to think more fully about how institutional support and partnership in stabilizing the content from the FB page might help support the community need to have an easy-to-use centralized platform that fed a stable archive.
