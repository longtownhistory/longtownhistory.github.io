headerexcerpt:  When I went to Palestine [Ohio] in junior high, it was so prejudiced, and then, you know, we’re free here at home. This is home. This is safety. This is free.... No matter where you go, how old you are, when you go home, you’re home. That’s here. That’s Longtown.

Since the 19th century rural black communities in the most anti-black and white-supremacist spaces have crafted ways to remember and preserve their *own* histories. Through their hard work and dedication, they acquired the resources to do so. Their definitions and realities of freedom had long lasting implications on future generations. 

This History Harvest, which took place in September 2019, is just one project among many that brings the work of free black rural communities and their craft into parallel with the technologies that have crafted the present archive in its digital form. Here, the descendants of Longtown present:

- Their [oral histories](/descendants) and [family collections of historical objects](/descendants)
- A [multi-family exhibit](/items) of the items that preserve Longtown's history in its descendants' homes
- A [tour of Longtown](/event) and guide to the [homecoming event](/event) at which the history harvest took place

Descendants of the Greenville/Longtown community have been working for years to preserve their history in a variety of ways, including a [very active Facebook community-run historical preservation page](https://www.facebook.com/Remembering-Freedom-James-Clemens-and-the-Longtown-Settlement-170627093017850/). This History Harvest is just one of those efforts. By bringing History Harvests and groundswell practices of community preservation to bear on the practices of traditional archival work, we can refocus the work of a historian. Traditional archives highlight the silence and the erasure of Black women; History Harvests, on the other hand, are more about abundance and joy, and the recentering of community voices that were once silent.
