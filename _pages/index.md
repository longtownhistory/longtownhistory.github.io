### The History of the free African American farming community of Greenville/Longtown


JAZMA HELP!

Since the 19th century rural black communities in the most anti-black and white-supremacist spaces have crafted ways to remember and preserve their own histories. Through their hard work and dedication, they acquired the resources to do so. Their definitions and realities of freedom had long lasting implications on future generations. 

This History Harvest project brings the work of free black rural communities and their craft into parallel with the technologies that have crafted the present archive in its digital form. Descendants of the Greenville/Longtown community have been working for years to preserve their history in a variety of ways. This History Harvest (footnote) is just one of those efforts. By bringing History Harvests and groundswell practices of community preservation to bear on the practices of traditional archival work, we can refocus the work of a historian. Traditional archives highlight the silence and the erasure of Black women; History Harvests, on the other hand, are more about abundance and joy, and the recentering of community voices that were once silent.
