USER GUIDE

The main content of this page is left empty on purpose. Instead, the information in the first few lines of this file, between the first --- and the second --- , set a specific series of options ("variables") for this page that define its layout and contents.

The "items" value for the "layout" variable includes a layout file stored at /_layouts/items.html . This file, in turn, looks for every file with a markdown extension (ends in ".md") in the items folder (/items/).

Each of those item .md files has its own set of variables and variable values, including a folder name that is drawn from the last name of the person who brought a specific heirloom. Using the item ID (the name of the file) and the folder name from the item's variables, the item layout finds matching photos, including a thumbnail (15g_th.jpg) in the item assets folder (/assets/collections/*foldername*/15g.jpg)
