*Roane Smothers:* Gonna try and get Anna-lisa Cox’s book, get that out as much as possible because that talks about....

*J: I’ve been seeing her book everywhere over the internet recently!*

*Roane Smothers:* Yes, this is not unusual. We thought, you know, even I thought this was unusual, no. This is part of....

*J: Even me, 5 years ago when I first started doing it. And then she has this book and I’m like “Oh!”*

*Roane Smothers:* Okay, right after here you’ll make a right turn into the driveway. Keep going up to the fencepost, right here. The house we think was built in 1850, close to it.

*J: Okay, we’ll just get out really fast.*

*Roane Smothers:* Yeah.

*J: We’re just, we’re just gonna get out really fast and like...*

*Roane Smothers:* The house was built in 1850 but...

*J: You bought the land in 1822?*

*Roane Smothers:* 1823(?)

*J: Can you record? Like video?*

*Roane Smothers:* This shows up in all the history books.

*J: Yeah.*

*Roane Smothers:* This was 1822, but I have the original deed, 1818. I beat the history books! So we’re putting on the historic monument “1818.” 

*J: And it was how far out here?*

*Roane Smothers:* The road was that way. The road was there.

*Interviewer 2: What about the barn?*

*Roane Smothers:* It was an English two-bay barn. Two... three bays, sorry.

\[muffled walking sounds]

*Roane Smothers:* \[??????]. This says “I made it! I’m rich.”

*J: This is awesome.*

*Roane Smothers:* And what I mean by that is if you go to the Levi Kauffman house, it has headlights, but not sidelights. This has got sidelights. The, uh, the foundation is limestone. So, he’s showing... one of the ways to show you’re rich is you a limestone foundation. To, um, and what that picture \[???], what was over the door.

Interviewer: And they missed the beginning part... you said that the land was bought...

**Roane Smothers:* bought in 1822. This particular piece of property.*

Interviewer: And this was the home of the first black landowner in...

*Roane Smothers:* Yes, James \[???]. Bought land in 1818. He was the first one here that officially bought land.

*J: Can I look in the window?*

*Roane Smothers:* Yeah, that’s why I want to show you the, the fireplace. You can see the fireplace from here, but you can see it, do you see the fireplace?

*J: Oh man, I need to come in here one day.*

*Roane Smothers:* You can see it inside. You see, you see?

*J: Okay, we can do it quickly. *

*Roane Smothers:* It has African motif. We think it’s related to a tribe in Africa, but we can’t really tell. Interviewer 3: Do you know where the \[???]’s were from?

*Roane Smothers:* Hm?

*J: Do you know where they were from? *

*J: Virginia.*

*Roane Smothers:* They were from Rockingham County in Virginia. Actually, James was the son of a white man from Augusta County, and...

*J: Are we going this way?*

*Roane Smothers:* Yeah. Sophia was the daughter of um....

*J: Adam Sellers.*

*Roane Smothers:* Rockingham County, \[???] slavemaster.

*J: What?*

*Roane Smothers:* Excuse the mess because...

*J: No, it’s fine.*

*Roane Smothers:* The racoons have gotten inside it.

*J: \[???] actually go into \[???].*

*Roane Smothers:* Whew, it smells funky. This is what I’ve said, this is the modernization when they put in the sink. But, they actually look like that. There’s this big old empty area that they put the sink in.

*J: Oh, look at the chandelier!*

*Roane Smothers:* This is the, see the boing boing boing? Smaller, larger, larger. And, we think that a tribe in Africa, it’s related to a tribe in Africa because I’ve been \[????] this, never seen a mantle 
like that before. There’s one that’s similar to it in Cherokee Chief in Georgia. I went to the house and it has a mantle similar to that.
Interviewer: We can put some of this corner, as this as an object, this house as an object. \[mumbling] 

*Interviewer 2: How long was this place inhabited for?*

*Roane Smothers:* About, uh, 1980’s.

*J: 1850 to 1980. And supposedly they assist their runaways here too, right? This is huge.*

\[lots of mumbling/ unintelligible chatter]

*J: Do people go upstairs?*

*Roane Smothers:* Um, you can but there’s no \[??], and there’s probably lots of excrement of racoons in there.

*J: Can you just walk up the stairs with your camera? I’m not gonna go all the way, I just wanna see.*

*Interviewer 2: Oh, there’s lots of crap up there.*

*Roane Smothers:* Is there lots of excrement up there?

*Interviewer 2: Right there, yeah.*

*J: Look at the room! This is so big.*

\[mumbling/ chatter]

*J: What would this have been? What would this have been?*

*Roane Smothers:* This is another room. The bathroom was put in later....\[mumbling]. 

*J: Because the lamp that Cleo had, Ms. Cleo had, Ms. Cleo. Um, said they didn’t have electricity until she was a teenager, so that was the lamp, the light that they used to use. Finally I feel complete! This is the only place I hadn’t been! It’s so weird how they add, like in today’s time, they put these roads and stuff so what is like, even at the Levi Kauffman house, like the back of their house ends up being on the main road when that was the front and it's more towards that way. I’m gonna look in the barn, there’s probably all types of \[???]. There’s still a piece of the wagon in there! Can you take a photo of that? I know they was hiding slaves up in here. If you go to the... I wish we had time to go to the Levi Kauffman one, cuz he’s like the most known for helping on the Underground Railroad, and if this house looks, that house is held up to be something special, but that house is WAY bigger. Okay, we’re just gonna stop at the other ones. *
