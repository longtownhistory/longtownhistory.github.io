*V: I noticed you brought in a few items today. Would you mind listing what those items are?*

**Patricia:** Pictures, my family, five generations, and just pictures that we’ve taken over the years. I was six years old when I moved to Longtown. So I’ve been here 79 years. So I know a good little history about Longtown the community. 

*V: Can you give a physical description of some of these photos? Like who is in the photos, what’s happening in these photos?*

**Patricia:** Yeah, The horse racing my family has been in horse racing for years and years. My father, my son, my brother, and my grandson. 

*V: What is the significance of the objects to you? What do they mean to you?*

**Patricia:** Well, it’s family. 

*V: And why did you want to bring in these items to represent family for this history harvest?*

**Patricia:** Well it’s just part of Longtown history. My parents went to school over here at the [?] schoolhouse. We’re all family kind of. Been here forever. 

*V: How do these photos reflect your identity or your sense of belonging to the Longtown community?*

**Patricia:** It just is it’s home, family. 

*V: So these pictures, what do they make you think of when you think of freedom or the Longtown community? What connections do those pictures have to freedom in the Longtown community?*

**Patricia:** Well, years ago when I was in grade school over here, we were all family. When I went to Palestine in junior high, it was so prejudiced, and then you know we’re free here, at home. I don’t have the feeling, even though Palestine is just a few miles away, I don’t have a feeling towards that part than I do here. This is home. This is safety. This is free. This is family. You know, I raised my family here. 

*V: Are there any other items you brought in today you want to talk more about?*

**Patricia:** No I don’t think.... I think Faith Ann. See, my parents had the tavern down the road. I don’t know if you got anything about that. I got a couple pictures. Not out front, but inside. And my dad sponsored a ball team. I have one of the uniforms. And it’s just home. I know, where you live, it home for right now, but when you go home, you got a feeling it’s home. No matter where you go, how old you are, when you go home, you’re home. That’s here. That’s Longtown.
